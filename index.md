## Software Conformance
 For enterprises and startups using Kubernetes, conformance guarantees interoperability from one Kubernetes installation to the next.
 With Kubernetes we can easily manage many virtual clusters for multiple development, testing and production environments using a range of container tools including Docker. With dockerized applications you can achieve high-availability, scalable infrastructure ready for hundreds of deployments per day.
